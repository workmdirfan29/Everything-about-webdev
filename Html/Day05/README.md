# Website Structure

This document outlines the typical structure of a basic website, divided into several sections such as navigation, header, main content, and footer.

## Navigation Section
The navigation section is typically used for navigation links.

```html
<nav>
  <!-- Navigation links can go here, for example: -->
  <!-- <ul> -->
  <!--   <li><a href="#">Home</a></li> -->
  <!--   <li><a href="#">About</a></li> -->
  <!-- </ul> -->
</nav>
```
## Header Section
The header section is often used for site branding, title, or introductory content.
```html
<header>
  <!-- Header content can go here, such as a logo, site name, or header image -->
  <!-- Example: <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1> -->
</header>
```
## Main Content Section
This is the main content area of the page where the majority of your content will be placed.
<section>
  <!-- Article content, typically an individual piece of content like a blog post -->
  <article>
    <!-- Content for the article goes here -->
    <!-- Example: <h2>Blog Post Title</h2> <p>Article content...</p> -->
  </article>
</section>

### Section 1: Main Content Block
``` html
<section>
  <!-- Article content, typically an individual piece of content like a blog post -->
  <article>
    <!-- Content for the article goes here -->
    <!-- Example: <h2>Blog Post Title</h2> <p>Article content...</p> -->
  </article>
</section>
```
### Section 2: Sidebar or Additional Content
```html
<section>
  <!-- Aside content, usually for side information, related links, or ads -->
  <aside>
    <!-- Content for the aside goes here -->
    <!-- Example: <h3>Related Articles</h3> <ul>...</ul> -->
  </aside>
</section>
```
### Footer Section
The footer section is typically used for copyright, contact information, or additional links.
```html
<footer>
  <!-- Footer content goes here -->
  <!-- Example: <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p> -->
</footer>
```
### Explanation of the HTML structure:

- Navigation (`<nav>`): A section for links that help users navigate through the website.
- Header (`<header>`): A place for your branding, such as the website's name or logo.
- Main Content (`<main>`): The primary content area of the page, often including articles or blog posts.
- Article (`<article>`): A self-contained piece of content, often used for blog posts or news articles.
- Aside (`<aside>`): Content that is related but separate from the main content, such as sidebars or advertisements.
- Footer (`<footer>`): Typically used for copyright information, contact details, or extra links.
