    <!-- Block-level element example -->
    <div style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">
      <!-- <div> is a block-level element, so it takes up the full width of its container. -->
      <h1>This is a Block-Level Heading</h1> 
      <!-- <h1> is a block-level element, so it will appear on a new line. -->
      <p>This paragraph is inside a <div> container. It takes up the full width of the container.</p>
      <!-- <p> is also a block-level element. It starts on a new line and takes up the full width. -->
    </div>

    <!-- Inline element example -->
    <p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> word inside a paragraph. The <span> tag is inline.</p>
    <!-- <span> is an inline element. It only takes up as much width as necessary and does not force a new line. -->
    <p>This is a <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">link</a> inside a paragraph. The <a> tag is also inline.</p>
    <!-- <a> is an inline element as well. It stays within the paragraph and does not break to a new line. -->
    
    <!-- Combining block and inline elements -->
    <div style="background-color: lightgray; padding: 10px;">
      <h2>Block and Inline Elements Together</h2>
      <p>Here is a <strong>strong</strong> word inside a block-level <p> tag. 
      <span style="color: green;">This span is inline</span>, so it won't create a new line.</p>
      <!-- <strong> is an inline element. It stays within the paragraph, but it gives bold style. -->
      <!-- <span> is inline, so it also stays in the flow without breaking the line. -->
