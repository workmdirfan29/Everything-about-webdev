# Learn how to connect JavaScript
### To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Create an HTML file `(index.html)`.

2. Create a JavaScript file `(app.js)` with the required code.
3. Link the `app.js` file to the HTML using the `<script>` tag.

# How It Works:
- When the page loads, the JavaScript from the `<script>` tags will be executed in the following order:

1. Inline JavaScript: Immediately logs the message to the console.
2. External JavaScript: The file external-script.js will be loaded and executed.
3. Async JavaScript: The script from async-script.js will load asynchronously and log its message to the console.

# How to Test:
- Save this HTML file as `index.html`.

- Create the two `external JavaScript files`, and `async-script.js`, and add the respective code.

- Open `index.html` in your browser and check the developer console (`press F12 `and go to the `"Console"` tab) to see the log outputs.
