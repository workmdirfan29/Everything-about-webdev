/*     <---------------------------------- var--------------------------->

    What it does: var is the old way to create a variable.
    Where it's used: A var variable can be used anywhere in the function or the whole program, depending on where itâ€™s created.
    Can you change it? Yes! You can change its value later.
    Why it's not great: It can be tricky because it doesn't always behave in the way you'd expect, especially when used inside loops or functions.

    var name = "Alice";
    name = "Bob";       // You can change the value
    console.log(name);  // Output: Bob
